# Machine-Learning-Algorithms
Recently, I review the Machine Learning and try to program all the algorithms of it only use numpy.
Maybe, it still has some mistakes, so you could tell me if you found.

## Progress
### model
* linear model
  1. linear regression
  2. logistic regression 
  3. ridge
  
* tree
  1. decision tree classifier
  
* neural network
  1. MLP classifier
  

__Note:__ Of course, you can learn the theory from the __ _init_ __.py in each model package. 


## Usage
Similar to *sci-kit learning*, import the model which you need, and .fit() it by the training dataset.
