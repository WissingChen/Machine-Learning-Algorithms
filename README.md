# Machine-Learning-Algorithms
Recently, I review the Machine Learning and try to program all algorithms of it only use __NumPy__

## Progress

- [ ] BayesRidge
- [ ] ARDRegression
- [ ] Perceptron
- [ ] PassiveAggressiveClassifier
- [ ] PassiveAggressiveRegression
  
### Decision Tree

### Neural Network
- [X] MLP Classifier *_performance of binary task is not good_
- [X] MLP Regression
    #### Solver
    - [X] SGD
    - [X] Momentum
    - [ ] AdaGrad

- [ ] ComplementNB

### Feature
- [ ] Ensemble
- [ ] Cluster
- [ ] Feature Select & Dimension Reduction
- [ ] Reinforcement Learning
- [ ] Probabilistic Model
  

__Note:__ Of course, it maybe still has some mistake


## Usage
Similar to *sci-kit learning*, import the model which you need, and .fit() it from the training dataset.
