# Machine-Learning-Algorithms
Recently, I review the Machine Learning and try to program all algorithms of it only use numpy
(maybe use some api from scipy).

##TODO

#### linear model
- [X] linear regression
- [X] ridge
- [X] RidgeClassifier
- [ ] lasso
- [ ] ElasticNet
- [ ] SGDClassifier
- [ ] SGDRegression
- [ ] LogisticRegression
- [ ] BayesRidge
- [ ] ARDRegression
- [ ] Perceptron
- [ ] PassiveAggressiveClassifier
- [ ] PassiveAggressiveRegression
  
#### tree
- [X] decision tree classifier
- [ ] decision tree regression
  
#### neural network
- [X] MLP classifier
- [X] MLP regression
  
#### svm
- [ ] svm classifier
- [ ] svm Regression

#### Feature
- [ ] bayes
- [ ] ensemble
- [ ] ....
  

__Note:__ Of course, it maybe still has some mistake


## Usage
Similar to *sci-kit learning*, import the model which you need, and .fit() it by the training dataset.
