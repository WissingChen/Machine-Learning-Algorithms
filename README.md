# Machine-Learning-Algorithms
Recently, I review the Machine Learning and try to program all the algorithms of it only use numpy
(maybe use some api from scipy).

## Progress
### model
* linear model
  1. linear regression
  2. ridge
  3. lasso
  
* tree
  1. decision tree classifier
  
* neural network
  1. MLP classifier
  
* svm
  1. svm Regression
  
* bayes
* ensemble
  

__Note:__ Of course, you can learn the theory from the __ _init_ __.py in each model package.


## Usage
Similar to *sci-kit learning*, import the model which you need, and .fit() it by the training dataset.
