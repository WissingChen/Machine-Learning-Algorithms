# Machine-Learning-Algorithms
Recently, I review the Machine Learning and try to program all algorithms of it only use __NumPy__
(maybe use some api from scipy).

## TODO

#### Linear Model
- [X] Linear Regression
- [X] Ridge
- [X] RidgeClassifier
- [X] Lasso
- [ ] ElasticNet
- [X] SGDClassifier
- [X] SGDRegression
- [X] LogisticRegression _(sometimes, still not good)_
- [ ] BayesRidge
- [ ] ARDRegression
- [ ] Perceptron
- [ ] PassiveAggressiveClassifier
- [ ] PassiveAggressiveRegression
  
#### Decision Tree
- [X] Decision Tree Classifier
- [X] Decision Tree Regression
  
#### Neural Network
- [X] MLP Classifier
- [X] MLP Regression
    #### Solver
    - [X] SGD
    - [X] Momentum
    - [ ] AdaGrad
    - [ ] RMSprop
    - [ ] Adadelta
    - [ ] Nesterov
    - [ ] Adma
    - [ ] AdaMax 
    - [ ] Nadam
    - [ ] AMSGrad

#### Support Vector Machine
- [X] SVC _stable, but still need modification_
- [X] SVR

#### Feature
- [ ] bayes
- [ ] ensemble
- [ ] ....
  

__Note:__ Of course, it maybe still has some mistake


## Usage
Similar to *sci-kit learning*, import the model which you need, and .fit() it by the training dataset.
